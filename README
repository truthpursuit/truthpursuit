Truth Pursuit
=============

   Truth Pursuit is a trivia tournament held in the Archdiocese of Anchorage
   which encourages junior high and senior high students to increase their
   knowledge of the Catholic faith.  

   The goal of this project is to provide software which helps youth and
   adult volunteers facilitate the tournament, provides a reliable and
   automated game "board", and allows other dioceses to easily host
   tournaments.

   If you are interested in contributing to this project or the tournament,
   please contact David M. Syzdek at syzdek@bindlebinaries.com.
